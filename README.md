InstaFilter app is built as tutorial material in https://www.hackingwithswift.com. InstaFilter app allows users to apply available filters 
to their selected images. CoreImage, ReviewRequest, ShareLink, Slider, ContentUnavaliableView, CIFilter, and AppStorage have been used in the
development. 

As the challenge, Gloom, Comic Effect and Pointillize Effects, Slider to arrange the radius of the filters and disabling sliders and change filter
button are added to the app.

Users upload the photo they want to apply a filter by tapping the add picture icon and selecting a photo from their gallery. InstaFilter has 
The "Use Camera" section is unfunctional now and will be functional in the future. When the photo is selected, The "Use Camera" section 
disappears. The "SepiaTone" is the default filter, so when a photo is uploaded, The "SepiaTone" filter is applied automatically.

Users could change the intensity and radius of the filters by dragging the slider to the right or left. Changing the radius and intensity
works together if the filter has both parameters. If the filter has only one of them, the existing parameter's slider applies the filter.
For instance, The "SepiaTone" filter has only intensity, so only the intensity slider works.

As seen below, The Gloom filter supports both intensity and radius parameters to apply the filter to the uploaded photo.
